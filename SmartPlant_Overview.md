# 🌿 Smart Plant: Your Automatic Garden Assistant

Welcome to **Smart Plant**! This project is designed to help anyone—from home gardeners to professional farmers—take perfect care of their plants without needing to be a computer expert.

## 🤔 What is Smart Plant?
Imagine a tiny helper that stays with your plant 24/7. It "feels" if the soil is dry, "senses" if it's too hot or cold, and can even water the plant for you automatically! 

You can check on your plant and control everything from your phone using a simple **Telegram chat bot**.

## 🚀 What can it do?

### 1. 💧 Smart Watering
*   **Automatic:** If the soil gets too dry, the system turns on a small pump to give the plant exactly what it needs.
*   **Manual:** You can press a button on the device or a button in the Telegram app to water it yourself.
*   **Protection:** It knows if your water tank is empty and will warn you to refill it.

### 2. 🌡️ Temperature Control
*   **Cooling Fan:** If the sun is too hot, a fan turns on to keep the plant fresh.
*   **Heater:** If it's a cold night, it turns on a heater (indicated by red lights) to keep the plant warm.
*   **Status Lights:** A green light tells you everything is "Just Right."

### 3. 📱 Remote Monitoring (Telegram Bot)
No matter where you are, you can ask the bot:
*   *"How is my plant doing?"* (It will tell you the moisture, temperature, and humidity).
*   *"Water it now!"* (It will trigger the pump).
*   *"Change settings"* (You can tell it to water more or less often).

### 4. 🧠 Intelligence (AI)
The system learns over time. It can tell you:
*   *"The plant looks healthy!"*
*   *"The plant is stressed, it might need more water soon."*

## 🛠️ How it works (The Simple Version)
1.  **Sensors (The Eyes):** These are stuck in the soil and air. they send information to a small "brain" (Arduino).
2.  **The Brain (Arduino & Raspberry Pi):** These process the info and decide what to do (like "It's dry, turn on the pump!").
3.  **Actuators (The Hands):** The pump, fan, and heater carry out the work.
4.  **Display:** A small screen on the box shows the current numbers for anyone standing nearby.

## 🌾 Why is this great for Farmers?
*   **Save Water:** Only water when the soil actually needs it.
*   **Save Time:** No need to walk to every pot or field every hour.
*   **Better Harvest:** Plants stay in their "happy zone" all the time, leading to better growth.
*   **Peace of Mind:** Get a notification if something is wrong (like no water in the tank).

## 📝 Simple Commands
If you use the Telegram bot, here are the main buttons:
*   📊 **Holat ko'rish (Status):** See current moisture and temperature.
*   💧 **Suv quyish (Water):** Give the plant some water.
*   ⚙️ **Sozlamalar (Settings):** Change how the system behaves.
