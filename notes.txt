Sensors:
- Soil Humidity Sensor (soil moisture)
- Temperature Sensors (LM35 and Temperature & Humidity Module)
- Humidity (from the Temperature & Humidity Module)
- Photocell Sensor (light intensity)


* “Imagine you have a thirsty plant. You want to water it just the right amount — not too much, not too little. But every day is different. Sometimes it’s hot and dry, sometimes cool and humid.
* Our system watches the plant’s soil and the weather all day long. It learns how fast the soil dries depending on the temperature and humidity — like a plant’s smart brain.
* Then, it tells the farmer exactly when to water, saving water and keeping the plant healthy.

For example:
	- Yesterday, watering at 10 AM kept the plant happy all day.
	- Today, it’s hotter, so the soil dries faster. The system learns this and says:
		‘Water now, or the plant will get thirsty.’
		Tomorrow, it might be cooler and more humid, so it says: ‘Wait, no need to water yet.’**
	- This smart learning happens all by itself, without internet or the farmer having to guess. It saves water, time, and helps crops grow better.”
